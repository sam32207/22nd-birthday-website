    <p>This is the first birthday of yours that we get to celebrate together, and hindi ko inaakala na I would be this excited. You know I don’t usually celebrate occasions, but with you, it’s different. With you, I want to make everything special.</p>

    <p>I want to say thank you, love, for being you. I’m so thankful for the person you are right now, so kind, so loving, so caring, so strong, and so understanding, especially when it comes to me and our relationship. I love everything about you: your smile, your voice, your hair, your height, your personality, your heart. I love all of it, and I wouldn’t change a single thing about you.</p>

    <p>Even though we’re in a long-distance relationship and don’t see each other every month, I still feel your presence every single day. You make me feel loved, supported, and understood in ways I’ve never felt before. I want you to know that I’ll always be your biggest supporter, the one who will stand by you and love you wholeheartedly, no matter what. </p>

    <p>I’ve been the happiest version of myself since the day I met you. I felt joy when I first knew you, excitement when I first saw you, gratitude when you told me you loved me, and since then, I’ve just been so content and in love. I really can’t imagine life without you, because the version of me right now wouldn’t even exist without you. If luck is real, then I’m the luckiest girl in the world because I have you. </p>

    <p>This is just our first birthday together, but my goal is to celebrate seventy more with you. I want to grow with you and someday build the family we've always dreamed about. I’ll do everything and anything I can, with all of my effort, to love you the way you deserve. </p>

    <p>I fall deeper in love with you every single day. Thank you for being my everything.</p>

    <p>Happy birthday, my love.</p>

    <p>From your girlfriend, soon your wife.</p>
